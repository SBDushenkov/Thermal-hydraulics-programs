Calculation of ring thermoelectric module for freezing

Ordinnary I use maple for this kind of calculations, but for this one i'd prefer use Jave for portability reasons

uses:
- "Maven" for dependencies and packaging
- "Apache POI" to get and store data in xlsx format*
- "jama" for linear basic solver**

* IMHO excel is better for scientific applications then any hand made table editors or any sort of enormous forms
** It's overkill, I understand this.
